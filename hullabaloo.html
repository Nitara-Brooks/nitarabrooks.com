<p> This project is an imagined branding for a new imprint company under Huzzah Books, Hullabaloo. In collaboration with Megan Aydelette, we created a playful apparatus composed of monochrome patterns, allowing for a flexible and versatile brand that can grow and evolve with the conversations Hullabaloo inspires.

The client had many ideas when it came to the visual identity of this company. Our first challenge was narrowing down and simplifying these themes and values into cohesive brand stories.
The through lines for any brand direction we decided to take were stepping away from corporate style design and placing importance on community, culture, and literature.

We presented these 3 directions based on information we gathered during our first meeting. Each approach geared towards different core values conveyed to us: History and cultural identity, collage and discovery, and playfulness.
     The client was draw to the broadness of the theme of play, not wanting a strict brand narrative. Combined with visual aspects from the other directions, we constructed our final product.

        The monochromatic color palette provides a way to keep the brand cohesive for when/ ifever other design elements become more wild and experimental.
        
      
        
            Once the visuals were pinned down, we were able to focus on important deliverables the client wanted to see, such as book covers and a seasonal catalogue spread. A lot of our energy went into these mockups, creating a system of patterns that not only organize genre, but pair the two elements together.

            A unique challenge we faced was pinning down a good medium for the brand. The client wished for Hullabaloo to have a separate identity and mission statement from Huzzah Books while finding a way for both brands to communicate. Flexibility was necessary.

            It was crucial that the brand be broad enough that it can freely change and evolve, yet designed enough to be recognizable as a staple of Hullabaloo. Seeing as the client is against rigid corporate/ traditional design, my partner and I included random aspects such as the origin and abstractness of the patterns. We develpoed a second book cover color variations depending on what fits each book as well as alternate logo marks (using different punctuation) to be used however the client sees fit.
