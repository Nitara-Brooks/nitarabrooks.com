<p> An imagined branding for a new in-print company under Huzzah Books. In collaboration with Megan Aydelette, we created a playful apparatus composed of monochrome patterns, allowing for a flexible and versatile brand that can grow and evolve with the conversations Hullabaloo inspires.

                <q>Hullabaloo is an in-print company that focuses on unconventional lost media. We create a space for
                    play and meaningful connections through reviving old literature. Our publications inspire conversations on
                    identity, language and communication.</q>

            The most important deliverables the client wanted to see were book covers and a seasonal catalogue spread. A lot of our energy went into these mockups, creating a system of patterns that not only organize genre, but pairs the two elements together.

            A unique challenge we faced was pinning down a good medium for the brand. The client wished for Hullabaloo to have a separate identity and mission statement from Huzzah Books while finding a way for the 2 brands to communicate. Flexibility was necessary.

            It was crucial that the brand be broad enough that it can freely change and evolve, yet designed enough to be recognizable as a staple of Hullabaloo. Seeing as the client is against rigid corporate/ traditional design, my partner and I included random aspects such as the origin and abstractness of the patterns. We develpoed a second book cover color variations depending on what fits each book as well as alternate logo marks (using different punctuation) to be used however the client sees fit.

            <br>
            The monochromatic color palette provides a way to keep the brand cohesive for when/ ifever other design elements become more wild and experimental.

            Creating additional merchandising helped the client see how the brand could be implemented in ways other than the main books and catalogue.
